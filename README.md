# Genomic-Data-Analysis-Dashboard
This project analyzes gene expression data (e.g., RNA-seq or microarray) to identify patterns, differential expression, and potential biomarkers. The analysis is performed in Python, and results are visualized in an interactive dashboard (e.g., Dash, Plotly, or Power BI).
